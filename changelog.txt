Twitch Golf changelog. im not adding previous versions to the change log

editor-update-alpha-0:
made the editor and debug menu windows movable and resizable
    - you move them from the white bar at the top of the window
    - the editor window can be locked, and you can choose if you want to allow the window to go out of the area of the page
made the number input boxes in the level editor menu much smaller because before they were THICC
made the hole a little bit less unpredictable
fixed level editor loading placed objects being centered on the top left corner of where it is supposed to be
added an option to the editor menu to change object color
added an option in the level format to skip alignment of a rectangle object. (can be overridden with the skipAlignment parameter on loadBodyFromJSON())
    - when this option is not selected on an rect (which is the default), its XY position is where its top left corner is
    - when this option is selected, its XY position is where its center is
    - if this option is put onto an object that is not a rect, nothing changes (the setting is ignored)
    - this option isnt avaliable in the level editor itself due to it only causing confusion due to the way the editor works
moved some things around in the level editor menu. probably going to make a whole new ui for it eventually because it looks awful right now
