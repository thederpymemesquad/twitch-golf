How to make a Twitch Golf language file:

Copy the en_us.json file in this folder, and name it whatever you want it to be
Open it with some text editor (notepad will work)
Find the things you want to change, and edit them!
you can delete entires in the file if you wish (they will fallback to en_us)
note that if you mess up the file syntax, it could break everything in the file!

you also should change the `lang.id`, `lang.author`, and `lang.ver` properies

to use the language file in the game, open `lang_list.json` in this folder, and add line between the first line with a `[` and the last line with a `]` in this format:
{"name": "name of language", "file": "name_of_lang_file.json"}
then open the game, open the debug menu, and select the language under the language option
