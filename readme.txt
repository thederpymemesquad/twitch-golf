You must use Chrome (or a Chromium based) webbroser for this to work! You must also launch the browser with the
"--allow-file-access-from-files" flag. To do this on windows, if your browser is on the pinned to the taskbar,
right click it, then right click the name of it (should be above unpin from taskbar), then click properties. you
should get a window with some options, find the "Target" option, go to the end, add a space, then paste
--allow-file-access-from-files
in the box. Note that this could be a security risk ONLY IF you download something malicous that runs as an html file,
but this will not allow random websites to access any of your files.
